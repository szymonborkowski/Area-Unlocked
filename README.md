# Area-Unlocked (Project In-Progress)
(Currently this project is in its initial stage)

This project tracks your runs and overlays them on top of each other on a map, the goal is to run every possible route in a given area because you can't fast travel to a street you haven't explored yet.

The game is to choose an area that you want to explore and use this project to keep track of your progress.
